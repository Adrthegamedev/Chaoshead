## Terminology
- World: the part of a level that contains all the level (world = level - metadata).
- Object: a single thing inside the level.
- (Level) element: a type of object e.g. Blasters, Armor Plates.
- Item: Something GR-18 can grab and carry.
- Mapping vs. Value (in the context of properties): a value is the raw number saved in the file, a mappnig is what that number means. E.g. value 1 for rotation is mapped to/mappnig "Up".
