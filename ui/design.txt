UI design:

Every UI has a parent except ui.base.root, which should be used as the root of the UI node tree.
For a list of events, check the stubs at the end of /base/node.lua

/widgets/:
Leaf nodes without children. Extend ui.base.node
Use :[event]() to handle events were needed.

/layout/:
These UIs are containers that position and resize their children. Extend ui.base.container
They should specify their own :resized() event handler.
Use :on[Event]() to execute events after they're normally executed.
Overwriting :[event]() prevents the event from propagating trough to the children.
:preDraw() exists to draw something before/behind the children.

/tools/:
These UIs are allowed to use the settings global (layouts should be generic and aren't).
